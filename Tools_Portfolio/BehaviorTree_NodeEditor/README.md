## BehaviorTree Node Editor

This was a side project turned into a contribution to my junior Game project (Haphazard300 engine for the game Cat's Cradle). 
Written using ImGui, this tool was originally a node editor for creating DSP effects from a node based DSP graph for a personal project. 
It was easily adapted into an editor for BehaviorTrees for the AI in the engine. 
Although the game never ended up needing AI, the editor and the BehaviorTrees are still fully functional.
The node editor backend was written by me, and the actual AI part of the BehaviorTrees was implemented by Brett Schiff. 
The code provided is not buildable, but there is a video demo of the product zipped in BehaviorTree_NodeEditor_Demo.zip and at: https://youtu.be/frY-5A-Dphs.
